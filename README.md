Loan Approval Prediction System

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant details. It uses Flask for the backend, a pre-trained machine learning model, and an HTML form for user interaction.

Objective

To build an intelligent system that assists financial institutions in making faster, data-driven loan approval decisions by predicting loan approval status based on applicant informa

Features

Web-based interface using Flask and HTML
Input form to enter applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, etc.
Predicts loan approval status instantly
Trained machine learning model for accurate predictions
Simple and intuitive user experience

Technologies Used

Python
Flask (Web Framework)
Pandas, Scikit-learn (ML model building)
HTML (Frontend)
VS Code(development)

How it Works

1. User inputs loan-related details via a web form.
2. The form data is sent to the backend Flask server.
3. A machine learning model processes the input and returns a prediction.
4. The prediction result (Approved/Rejected) is shown on the webpage.
